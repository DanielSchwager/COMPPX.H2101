## Intro

This module explored different applications of ML/AI/DL, with a particular focus on design and art.
My goal was to create a prototype that generates an audio file from stock charts.

## Procedure

First, I looked for a generative adversarial audio network. I quickly found one and discovered the GANSynth from magenta. Now I played around with the Google Collab notebook and I quickly realized that I now need a midifile as input.

Creating a midi file was fortunately quite easy thanks to the MidiUtil library.
Next I had to get the input for the midifile.

## Self-reflection

To conclude, I actually wanted to turn the whole thing into one project
